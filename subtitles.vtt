Welcome. Hey, I'm Anton

2
00:00:03.016 --> 00:00:04.152
and I can speak

3
00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:05.512
English. But that's not

4
00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:06.600
all. I can also

5
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.672
throw some Spanish into

6
00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:09.672
the mix. Or Japanese.

7
00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.352
Ruski. Allow me to

8
00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:12.696
translate my content into

00:00:12.768 --> 00:00:14.552
65 languages. Try it
